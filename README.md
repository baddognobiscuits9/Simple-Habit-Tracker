# Atomic Habit Tracker ⚛️

> "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems." — James Clear

A minimalist, AI-powered habit tracker designed to help you build consistency and break bad habits. Built because tracking shouldn't be a chore—it should be a system for improvement.

## 🌟 Why this tracker?

I built this app while reading **Atomic Habits** by James Clear. I needed a tool that wasn't just about ticking boxes, but about **tracking the good habits I want to keep** and understanding the patterns behind them.

Most trackers are static. This one is intelligent.

## ✨ Features

- **Daily Focus**: A distraction-free interface to log your daily 1% improvements.
- **AI Coaching (Powered by Gemini)**: Unlike standard trackers, this app includes an AI coach that analyzes your consistency, notes, and trends to offer personalized advice.
- **Visual Analytics**: Interactive charts to visualize your momentum.
- **Data Sovereignty**:
    - **CSV Export**: Analyze your data in Excel or Google Sheets.
    - **Markdown Export**: Copy your 30-day history directly into Notion, Obsidian, or Apple Notes.
- **Privacy First**: Your data lives in your browser's local storage.

## 🛠️ Built with Google AI Studio

This project was crafted using **Google AI Studio**, leveraging the cutting-edge **Gemini 2.5 Flash** model to power the intelligent coaching features.

**Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **AI Integration**: Google GenAI SDK (`@google/genai`)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Charts**: Recharts

## 📊 Visuals

The app features a clean, OpenAI-inspired aesthetic:

1.  **Tracker View**: A simple grid for your daily logs.
2.  **Stats Dashboard**: Beautiful area and bar charts showing your consistency rates over 14 days and 6 months.
3.  **AI Chat**: A conversational interface to discuss your progress with Gemini.
